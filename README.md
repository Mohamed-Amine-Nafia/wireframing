Wireframing
ðŸ“„ Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, application, or digital product. It is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process, helping designers and stakeholders visualize the layout, structure, and functionality before any development begins.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Wireframing is Important
Clarifies Ideas: Helps translate ideas into visual representations.

Improves Communication: Facilitates discussions among designers, developers, and stakeholders.

Saves Time and Cost: Identifies issues early in the design process before coding starts.

Focuses on Structure: Concentrates on layout, navigation, and user flow without being distracted by colors, images, or fonts.

Enhances User Experience: Helps in crafting a logical and user-friendly interface.
